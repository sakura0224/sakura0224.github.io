## üë• Experience

### "Arrived or Not" ‚Äî Design of an Intelligent Teaching System Platform Based on Machine Vision  
*Role*: Co-Leader  
*Advisor*: [Qi Zhang, PhD, Professor](https://scie.shu.edu.cn/Prof/zhangq.htm)  
*Shanghai, China* (December 2023 ‚Äì Present)

- Designed and implemented a **real-time facial recognition system** using **RetinaFace** for face detection and **ArcFace** for feature extraction and identification. Improved attendance tracking efficiency and prevented fraudulent check-ins (e.g., proxy sign-ins).
- Developed a **multi-functional mobile application** for teachers and students, featuring **class management**, automated **attendance tracking** with facial recognition, and **real-time data analysis** to monitor student engagement.
- Ensured scalability and performance with **frontend-backend separation** using **Flutter** (frontend) and **FastAPI** (backend), optimizing real-time processing and cloud integration.

### Image Captioning using CNN and Transformer  
*Role*: Leader  
*Advisor*: [Qi Zhang, PhD, Assistant Professor](https://scie-ce.shu.edu.cn/info/1092/1127.htm)  
*Shanghai, China* (August 2024 ‚Äì October 2024)

- Implemented image caption generation using a **Transformer Decoder** in PyTorch, with **ResNet50** for image feature extraction and **GloVe embeddings** for word representations.
- Trained on the **Flickr8K** dataset (8,000+ images with 5 captions each). Supports **greedy decoding** and **beam search decoding** for caption generation.
- Evaluated performance using **BLEU scores** and **ROUGE scores** to assess caption quality.
